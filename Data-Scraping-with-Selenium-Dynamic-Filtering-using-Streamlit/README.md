 # Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
 ## Introduction
*The Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application project is designed to transform the transportation industry by offering an    end-to-end solution for gathering, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. Leveraging Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of comprehensive information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. By simplifying the data collection process and providing advanced tools for data-driven decision-making, this project can significantly enhance operational efficiency and strategic planning within the transportation sector.

Selenium

## FEATURES OF APPLICATION

## Retrive the Bus Information:
   Selenium, a robust tool for automating web browsers, is particularly effective for web scraping tasks. This application uses Selenium to automate the retrieval of bus details from Redbus by simulating user interactions such as searching for buses, interacting with input fields and buttons, waiting for page load, and extracting the desired data from search results

 ## Store data in database:
   The retrieved bus data is converted into Pandas DataFrames and subsequently stored in a MySQL database. A new database and tables are created using MySQL connectors, and the data is efficiently inserted into the respective tables for easy access and management within the MySQL environment.

## web app - streamlit:
   Streamlit is used to develop an interactive web application that emulates the functionality of Redbus. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for bus routes, view available buses, and access details such as departure times and ticket prices.
